## Introduction
Welcome to the extended Delhivery EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) report! This document dives deeper into our analysis of the Delhivery logistics dataset, focusing on detailed variables related to trip management and delivery performance.

## Dataset Overview
- **Source:** Delhivery Logistics Dataset
- **Variables Analyzed:**
  - **source_name:** Name of the trip origin source.
  - **destination_center:** ID of the destination center.
  - **destination_name:** Name of the destination.
  - **od_start_time:** Timestamp when the trip started.
  - **od_end_time:** Timestamp when the trip ended.
  - **start_scan_to_end_scan:** Time taken to deliver from source to destination.
  - **is_cutoff, cutoff_factor, cutoff_timestamp:** Fields related to cutoff information.
  - **actual_distance_to_destination:** Distance in kms between source and destination warehouses.
  - **actual_time:** Cumulative actual time taken for delivery.
  - **osrm_time:** Cumulative time calculated by the OSRM routing engine.
  - **osrm_distance:** Cumulative distance calculated by the OSRM routing engine.
  - **factor:** Unknown field.
  - **segment_actual_time:** Time taken by subsets of the package delivery.
  - **segment_osrm_time:** OSRM-calculated time for subsets of the package delivery.
  - **segment_osrm_distance:** OSRM-calculated distance for subsets of the package delivery.
